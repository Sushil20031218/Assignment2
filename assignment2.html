            <h2>Lyrics</h2>
            <p>
                (Verse 1)<br>
                There's a sign at the bottom of the overpass<br>
                Says "Welcome to Dixie" on a piece of tin<br>
                Might as well say "You're on your own, son"<br>
                When you cross that yellow line, you don't come back again<br>
                There's a bridge to the south with a painted arrow<br>
                There's a river runnin' wide that you can't swim<br>
                They say freedom's just on the other side<br>
                But the price you gotta pay is blood and skin<br>
                <br>
                (Chorus)<br>
                The borderline's a hard line<br>
                You gotta know which side you're on<br>
                Ain't nobody winnin' when it comes down to it<br>
                It's a fight you can't run from<br>
                You can run, you can hide<br>
                But you'll never make it out alive<br>
                When you cross that borderline<br>
                <br>
                (Verse 2)<br>
                There's a girl in the moonlight waitin' on a hero<br>
                In a little town that the world forgot<br>
                She's been waitin' for a long time, thinkin' any day now<br>
                Somebody's gonna come and give her all she's got<br>
                But the years roll by like a heartache<br>
                And the only thing that ever rolls in is the dust<br>
                And she's startin' to wonder if the only thing worth lovin'<br>
                Is the man that's gonna come and take her trust<br>
                <br>
                (Chorus)<br>
                The borderline's a hard line<br>
                You gotta know which side you're on<br>
                Ain't nobody winnin' when it comes down to it<br>
                It's a fight you can't run from<br>
                You can run, you can hide<br>
                But you'll never make it out alive<br>
                When you cross that borderline<br>
                <br>
                (Bridge)<br>
                They say it's greener on the other side<br>
                But you gotta climb a fence to find out<br>
                And once you're over, you realize<br>
                It ain't worth what you left behind<br>
                <br>
                (Chorus)<br>
                The borderline's a hard line<br>
                You gotta know which side you're on<br>
                Ain't nobody winnin' when it comes down to it<br>
                It's a fight you can't run from<br>
                You can run, you can hide<br>
                But you'll never make it out alive<br>
                When you cross that borderline<br>
                <br>
                You'll never make it out alive<br>
                When you cross that borderline<br>
            </p>
